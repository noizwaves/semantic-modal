# Semantic Modal

The goal of this code is to style a confirmation as a modal while keeping the markup "pure".

Most modal implementations fail to do this, due to the requirement of "overlay" elements, or changing the attributes of the body element.

This code illustrates how a modal visual can be achieved using only CSS.
